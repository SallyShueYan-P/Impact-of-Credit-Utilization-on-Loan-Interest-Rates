# Impact-of-Credit-Utilization-on-Loan-Interest-Rates
In this study, we explore the relationship between credit utilization and loan interest rates using a loan dataset. RStudio serves as a comprehensive tool for data processing, statistical analysis, and data visualization. It enables us to employ various techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression. PCA helps reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining crucial information. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. Additionally, linear regression sheds light on the association between a continuous dependent variable and an independent variable. Through these analyses, we aim to uncover insights into how credit utilization impacts loan interest rates. The appendices provide detailed procedures and codes for reference.

The findings reveal that credit utilization has a significant effect on loan interest rates, enabling both consumers and lenders to make informed decisions regarding credit policies. RStudio's array of functionalities, including conditional expressions, iterative operations, and built-in technicians, empowers us to perform sophisticated statistical procedures. By leveraging data processing, statistical analysis, and data visualization capabilities, this study contributes to understanding the intricate dynamics between credit utilization and loan interest rates.
